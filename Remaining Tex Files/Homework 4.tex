\paragraph{1a} Let graph $Q_n$ be a hypercube. We observed that for $n$, there are even and odd parity bits. In n = 1 the path is 1-0, in n = 2 the paths are 00-10, 00-01, 01-11, 10-11. In both examples you can see how the paths are between even parity and odd parity binary strings creating an expilcit bipartation of the verticies.
\paragraph{1b} $2^{n-1}n$
\paragraph{1c}Let graph $Q_n$ be a hypercube. Base case: G(V,E)

\paragraph{4}The problem cant be satisfied because in the 11 games you have to play within your own division, the teams end up making pairs with another team for their 11th game which leaves 1 team unable to play 11 games.

\paragraph{6}$(0+1)^*x^*(0+1)^*$!$x^*(0+1^*)$
